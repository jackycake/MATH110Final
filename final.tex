\textbf{Final} \\  
MATH 110\\
Due Friday Dec 15, 5pm.
\end{center}

\medskip

Find and analyze a dataset.   In your analysis, please describe your dataset in enough detail so I can understand what you are doing.  You should specify the question(s) you are seeking to answer.   Your goal is to use R to do some interesting analysis.   

\vspace{.3cm}

Your code should include objects.  Your code can include functions not associated with an object, but the objects you design should underlie and provide the basis for your code and analysis.  

\vspace{.3cm}

You must use ggplot2 at least once in your analysis. 

\vspace{.3cm}

You should, as usual, separate your work into R/, data/ and analysis/ directories.   Fork my github repo SLeviyang/MATH110Final and submit the final by executing a pull request.  Please place your work in a directory named \verb+myname_final/+, where myname is your name, and push that directory to your fork.   DO NOT INCLUDE THE DATASET IN YOUR PUSH, UNLESS THE DATASET IS LESS THAN 100K.
